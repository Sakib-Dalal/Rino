# RIHNO WEB APP

## Frontend 

The frontend of the RIHNO is build using react.js, tailwindcss and threejs. We used react.js because it has capability for building user interfaces. We used tailwindcss for creating and using beautiful UI components. Next we used threejs which is a npm package that helps you to render 3D models on your web pages.

To get started use this commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will install all the dependencies and start a local development server. You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` to see the application running.

## Backend

The backend of RIHNO is built using Node.js and Express.js. We used Node.js because it is a powerful and efficient runtime environment for building server-side applications. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

To get started with the backend, use these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install all the dependencies and start the backend server. You can then access the backend API at `http://localhost:PORT/api`.
